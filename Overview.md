# Welcome Aboard!

Greetings, and welcome to Slaughter County Brewing Company!

Since the Age of Sail, crew members and officers, on joining a ship, would draw up their own code, or articles, which provided rules for their code of conduct, job descriptions, payments, etc.
This document serves the same purpose at Slaughter County.
It's not here to vent a pile of boilerplate legal mumbo-jumbo or impose a list of rules on the lowly employee -- it's here to help clarify our expectations and to ensure they're inline with yours before you formally join our crew.

This document itself is a living document and will continue to grow and change with Slaughter County.  It works as a primary guidebook, and may be overridden by future changes, memos, or addendums.  

Confidential information will not be included in this handbook, but may be distributed in additional memos, both of which should be treated with the same gravity.

If you have any questions about anything contained herein, please feel free to ask a manager or officer, and if you have an suggestions for this manual, please don't hesitate to let us know.  

To our clients, Slaughter County is primarily about our team. If you've been hired here, it's because we believe you can contribute substantially.  We want to see you succeed, and we're investing in that.
