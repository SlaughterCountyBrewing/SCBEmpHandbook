# Code of Conduct

Most of the items in here may look like they only apply to FOH (front of house) or kitchen staff, however, keep in mind that all employees contribute to the customer experience and oftentimes our jobs overlap and employees from one department may step in to help out in other roles.  Everyone should be aware of the Code of Conduct and should conduct themselves and their duties in accordance with the spirit and overarching goals of this section.

## Drinking on-site

We want you to enjoy hanging out at Slaughter County Brewery as much as our customers do, but employee/staff alcohol abuse and misbehavior is a real issue in our business and we have to be cognizant of the problem for the safety, enjoyment, and well being of our staff as well as for our customers.

Drinking alcohol, just like drug use, is not allowed when an employee is "on-the-clock."  Sampling and tasting is part of our job, and as a manufacturer, QA testing is allowed -- this is the **only** "on-the-clock" alcohol consumption that's allowed.  Even when "off the clock," employees and staff should never be anhibriated on-site.  Here's some basic guidelines for code-of-conduct, on-site, off-the-clock alcohol consumption:

- A good rule of thumb is about a maximum of 3 full alcoholic beverages when on site.
- Limit yourself to lower ABV drinks.
- Limit yourself to about one drink per hour.
- Eat and have a non-alcoholic beverage (water) between alcoholic drinks.

Laws and regulations regarding overservice and intoxication apply to employees, staff, and owners the same way they do to customers.  Slaughter County will not retaliate against you for refusing service (cutting off) anyone (including an owner or manager) that is apparently intoxicated.  Anyone that does retaliate will face disciplinary action.

To review, here's the rules from the WSLCB website:

>Overservice  

>- You may not sell alcohol to apparently intoxicated customers
>- You may not allow apparently intoxicated customers to consume or possess alcohol
>- You must remove the customer's drink and refuse further alcohol service
>- An intoxicated customer may remain at your business if they don't have any alcohol

> Disorderly conduct  

>- Disorderly conduct by customers, owners and employees is not permitted
>    - Allowing fights, not calling police, etc.
>- No owner or employee may drink alcohol while working
>    - Employees include DJ's, musicians and karaoke operators
>- No owner or employee may show signs of intoxicated while at the premises, whether they are working or not
>- Criminal conduct by customers, owners and employees is not permitted
>    - Drugs, etc.


## Appearance

You be you, but please don't come in dressed so inappropriately that we have to write up a formal dress code.  Think of it like this:  If you're going out with friends you haven't seen in a while, you're probably not going to totally slum it.
Our customers may be in that situations - out with friends or on a date - and they don't want to walk into a place where the staff looks like they just rolled out of bed or haven't bathed in a week.

One hard rule we do have:  NO HAIR PENS!  Don't keep a pen in your hair - it's unsanitary and creeps people out.
