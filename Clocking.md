## Clocking In And Out : 

- **Opening**:  Clock in no more than 10 minutes before your scheduled start time.  It is allowed and ok to clock in late, but we must be open to the public on time (cash in till, lights on, ready to serve beer & pizza ).  If you need to clock in earlier than your scheduled start time, get approval from your manager (or immediate superior) and write the reason in the logbook.

- **Mid-Day Starts**:  Clock in no more than 10 mins before your shift starts, and be working at your scheduled time.  

  - If you need to start early (additional prep work, cleaning, special projects, etc.), get prior approval, and put the reason in the logbook.  

  - Any late-start requires 24 hr advanced notice and manager approval.  In the case of a last minute change or emergency that requires a late start, contact your manager immediately and assist in getting the shift covered.

  - Late starts without prior approval will lead to disciplinary action.  

- **Mid-Day Ends**:  Clock out no more than 10 mins after your shift ends.  The pub should be stocked, prepped, clean, and ready to hand over to the next shift at the time of shift change.  If you cannot get the pub ready because it’s busy, stay a bit late to help with the transition and record the reason for the overlap in the logbook.  If you’re covering for a late-start or no-show, record that in the logbook.

- **Closing**:  Use the time leading up to close to prep, clean, stock, and pre-handle the closing procedures.  If, at close, we have customers that are continuing to order, stay open.  If you’re not getting at least $20 per hour in orders, do last call and close up.  **Closing when we’re actually still busy can lead to disciplinary action**.  If you are clocked in for more than an hour after our posted hours (even for cleanup, prep work, etc.), record the reason in the logbook.  Early closing is allowed with prior manager approval, but **all prep, stocking, and cleanup must be complete before clock-out**.

- **All Shifts**:  No-Call-No-Shows will lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
