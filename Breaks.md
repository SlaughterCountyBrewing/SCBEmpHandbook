### WA State Defined “Rest Breaks,” and “Meal Breaks.”

- 10 minute “rest” breaks:

    - The following are considered “break times”:  Smoke breaks,
    snack time, personal phone calls, personal conversations, or even,
    “whenever there is no work to do for a few minutes during a work
    shift” -- aka, “time to lean.”

    - “Rest” breaks do not need to be uninterrupted -- you may take
    several “mini” breaks up to your allowed break time.

    - If you work less than 4 hours:  No breaks.

    - If you work between 4 and 8 hours:  You are allowed, but not
    required, up to 10 minutes of total break time.

    - If you work between 8 and 12 hours:  You are allowed, but not
    required, up to 20 minutes of total break time.

    - You are required to stay on-site during these breaks, and interrupt
    your break times, as needed, to attend to work duties.

- 30 minute “meal” break (this is in addition to the “rest”
breaks outlined above) :

    - If you work 5 hours or more:  You are allowed, but not required,
    to take up to 30 minutes of “meal” break.

    - If you are required to stay on-site with the possibility of
    interrupting your meal break to attend to work duties, this will be
    a paid meal break.

    - If we have the staffing, or someone willing to relieve you for an
    uninterrupted break, you will, if you opt to take your meal break,
    take the ½ hour meal break unpaid -- you can take this break on-site
    or off.  Remember to clock-out & clock back in.

    - By law, your “meal” break may not start until after you’ve
    been on shift at least 2 hours.  We would prefer to allow the
    “meal” break at any time, but this is the law.

    - If we make you Interrupt a non-paid meal break with work duties,
    the break will be converted to a paid meal break.

### Schedules and Hours Worked

- Schedules may change at any time without notice.  Business requires
us to adapt quickly.

- Our business depends heavily on weekends, holidays, and events.
You will be called upon to work weekends, holidays, & events, even if
these dates are not part of your “normal” schedule rotation.

- Similar to schedule changes, duties and job descriptions may change
at any time without notice.  Current job duties are to be executed
regardless of what your job duties may have been in the past.

- “Hours worked,” (ie, “the hours you’re being paid for”),
will include the time you are on-site and executing your job duties.
Unless specifically stated, in advance, “hours worked” will not
include travel time, training, off-site events, or meetings.

- Attendance at non-paid training, meetings, and events is optional,
but these are offered for your benefit.  You are expected to know your
job -- to know craft beer, brewing, etc.  You can educate yourself,
or take advantage of what we offer.  It benefits you, and enables you
to become a better, more efficient team member when you understand our
business strategies, goals, and core values.

- Attendance at paid training, meetings, and events is required and
considered a scheduled shift.  The same rules apply to these as apply
to any normal shift.

If you’re clocked in, and not on an allowed break, you are to be
working.  There is never “nothing to do.”  The slower business is,
the more spotless and welcoming Slaughter County Brewery should be.
