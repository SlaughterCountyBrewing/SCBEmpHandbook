## Time Off / Sick Days / Vacations / Schedule Changes

- Once scheduled, you are required to be on time, to competently execute your job duties, and to work your full, scheduled shift.

- No-Call No-Shows are a serious violation of policy and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

- Missed shifts, not previously approved by a manager, are a serious violation of policy and can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

- Any non-emergency switching of shifts must be done with 24 hrs notice and manager approval.

- If you must call in sick or miss a shift due to an emergency, contact a manager as soon as possible, and if you can, please help us find someone to cover for you (switch shifts if possible).

- More than 2 sick days in 28 days (approximately two pay periods) will require a Dr's note.

- Any scheduled days off must be requested, in writing, a minimum of 14 days in advance and approved by a manager. A proper request doesn't guarantee approval, so the more advance notice you can give, the more likely it is that your request will be approved.

- Showing up late or leaving early may be considered an unapproved "schedule change" -- Schedule changes are not allowed without prior manager approval except as outlined in our "Clocking In And Out" procedures (briefly, you may show up late if you can get opened up in time, and you may work late if we're still busy at closing time -- beyond those two cases, be on time).

- A hangover is an avoidable issue, not a legitimate illness. Poor job performance, unapproved schedule changes, and missed shifts due to hangovers (be they alcohol, drug, or party exhaustion related) are a serious policy violation and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination -- in other words, have fun, but don't let it affect your job.
