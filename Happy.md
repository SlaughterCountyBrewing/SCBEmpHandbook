## Happy Hour Rules (when applicable):

- 3 to 5 pm, Monday thru Friday

- $4.00 SCB Pints - not guest taps, cider, etc.

- All Happy Hour orders must be put into the register before the end of Happy Hour.  Do not price adjust outside those hours to *create* Happy Hour pricing unless given specific authorization to do so (e.g. we might run a special day, or extended happy hour times, or something like that)

- Happy Hour beers may be purchased on a tab -- regular “tab” rules apply (meaning, if you *don’t* take a card, and customer walks out w/o paying, you owe for that tab and it’s up to you if you want to recover the money from the customer)

- In addition to the current Happy Hour beer that a customer has purchased, they may prepay, during happy hour, for ONE additional beer at happy hour prices.  Give that customer a token at the time the order was placed.

- Pay It Forward:

    - A customer may buy ONE “pay it forward” beer for another customer, during happy hour, at happy hour prices.

    - A customer may buy “pay it forward” beers for multiple customers, but only one beer for each at happy hour prices.

    - (we need to put together a pay-it-forward board -- until then, treat this pretty informally)  :-)

- Call Ahead:

    - a customer may call ahead to order a happy hour beer.  Put the order in as a tab to get the happy hour price.  That beer must be poured no later than 15 minutes after the end of happy hour.  If the customer can’t make it in by then, they can’t get happy hour pricing.  You’re not responsible for this tab (i.e. “normal tab rules” don’t apply) until after that beer is poured.
