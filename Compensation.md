# Compensation

## Payday and Pay Period Schedules

Pay periods are bi-monthly; from the 1st to the 14th and from the 15th to the last day of each month.  Paychecks are distributed within 5 days of the end of the pay period.

A pay stub with your Statement of Earnings will be included with your paycheck. It is your responsibility to check this statement carefully and report any questionable deductions or mistakes immediately.

Direct deposit is not available at this time, but these procedures may change if and when we start using direct deposit and/or go paperless.

## Tips

Cash tips are distributed at the end of your shift, credit card tips will be accrued and included in your paycheck.  Our credit card service provider charges a flat 4% rate on all transaction - this 4% will be deducted from the credit card tips.  Encourage your customers to tip cash.  When you go out somewhere, always try to tip with cash rather than credit card.  

Credit card tips are recorded in the daily closing record and are reported in the timeclock app (homebase).  Reporting of cash tips is the employee responsibility and it handled according to industry standard practices.

In normal situations, the "bar captain" will be responsible for tip distribution.

When multiple, non-brewery staff are working, and especially during large, all-hands-on-deck events, tips will be pooled and distribution will be handled by the bar captain or an on-site manager.
