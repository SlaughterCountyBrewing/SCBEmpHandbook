# Welcome Aboard!

Greetings, and welcome to Slaughter County Brewing Company!
We were founded in 2011 and our doors opened up in the summer of 2012.  Our goal was twofold:  Brew great beers, and create a uniquely welcoming, fun, and safe environment to work and hang out.

Since the Age of Sail, crew members and officers, on joining a ship, would draw up their own code, or articles, which provided rules for their code of conduct, job descriptions, payments, etc.
This document serves the same purpose at Slaughter County.
It's not here to vent a pile of boilerplate legal mumbo-jumbo or impose a list of rules on the lowly employee -- it's here to help clarify our expectations and to ensure they're inline with yours before you formally join our crew.

This document itself is a living document and will continue to grow and change with Slaughter County.  It works as a primary guidebook, and may be overridden by future changes, memos, or addendums.  

Confidential information will not be included in this handbook, but may be distributed in additional memos, both of which should be treated with the same gravity.

If you have any questions about anything contained herein, please feel free to ask a manager or officer, and if you have an suggestions for this manual, please don't hesitate to let us know.  

To our clients, Slaughter County is primarily about our team. If you've been hired here, it's because we believe you can contribute substantially.  We want to see you succeed, and we're investing in that.


### Some quick facts:

- We were founded in 2011
- Yes, we have cannon shows at our anniversary parties
- We have changed our menu - a lot.  You will have people asking for things we don't make anymore; like Chicken Curry Soup.
- You'll here this a lot:  We're small.  We value frugality and the power and flexibility of small teams.  Even if we had giant financing we would favor smaller, more multi-talented teams.
- We don't make a ton of IPAs.  We generally lean towards a traditional, more malty, English style, but we also tend to prioritize variety and quality of beers over having multiple IPAs.
