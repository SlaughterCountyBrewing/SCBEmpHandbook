## Discounts

This is different from what we've done in the past, but hopefully a lot simpler:

- **Employee** - 40%
- **Friends & Family** - 10%

The **Employee discount** applies to food, beer, and swag, but does not apply to friends and family's drinks, food, etc.

The **Friends & Family Discount** works as, and may be applied as a **Loyalty**, **Locals**, **Military/Police/Fire**, & **Industry** discount.  This discount is about our belief in the marketing power of our employees, family, and friends.  It's a descretionary discount that you can extend to anyone you think it may work with to help build loyalty, or to show appreciation or our thanks.  Please don't be lazy and just apply it to everyone and definitely don't be using it to give a stranger a discount in order to try and score a bigger tip - this would be considered a violation of this Discount policy.
