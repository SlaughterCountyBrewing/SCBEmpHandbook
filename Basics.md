# Employment Basics

## Employment types

Full-time employees work at least 32 hours per week.

Part-time employees are those who work fewer than 32 hours per week.

Full-time and part-time employees can have either temporary or indefinite duration contracts. Full-time employees under an indefinite duration contract may be paid salary and would qualify for any available company benefits.

Employment in Washington State is “at-will.” This means that the employment relationship may be terminated at any time and for any non-discriminatory reason(s).


## Equal opportunity employment

Slaughter County Brewing Company is an equal opportunity employer. We don’t tolerate discrimination against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, veteran status.) We want all employees (including executives and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. In practice, this means that we:

- Hire and promote people based on skills, experience or potential and try to reduce bias in every process (e.g. through structured interviews.)
- Make accommodations to help people with disabilities move about safely on our premises and use our products, services and equipment.
- Use inclusive, diversity-sensitive language in all official documents, signs and job ads.

Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive or inappropriate behavior. To do this properly, we ask you to report any discriminatory action against yourself or your colleagues to HR, a manager, or owner. Our company will not retaliate against you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any employee who retaliates or discriminates will face disciplinary action.


## Recruitment and selection process

Our hiring steps might vary across roles, but we always aim for a recruitment and selection process that is fair and effective in hiring great people. 

Throughout the hiring process, we aim to keep candidates informed, communicate well and give everyone an equal opportunity to work with us. 


## Background checks

We run cursory background checks on candidates.  These checks include reference checks, perusing social media, public records searches, etc.  We are looking to fact-check application information,
confirm employment requirements, and find candidates who will foster our culture.


## Referrals

If you know someone who you think would be a good fit for a position at our company, feel free to refer them.  Referrals can be one of the best ways to find great candidates.



## Attendance

We expect you to be present during your scheduled working hours. If you face an emergency that prevents you from coming to work one day, contact your manager as soon as possible. We will excuse unreported absences in cases of serious accidents, acute medical emergencies, etc. But, whenever possible, we need to know when you won’t be coming in.
