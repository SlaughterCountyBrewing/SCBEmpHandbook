## Kitchen Inventory and Prep

Overriding theme:  “NO SURPRISES.”

Secondary theme:  “We can’t sell what we don’t have.”

Prep work and kitchen inventory is the responsibility of the kitchen staff, when we have kitchen staff -- Under full staffing, bar-staff would not be expected to prep, do food inventory, shopping, or kitchen ordering.  Bar-staff is expected, at all times, to help as a line-cook/helper, when needed and when possible.  When we don’t have kitchen-staff, prep is the responsibility of bar-staff.  Remember, “no surprises.”  Don’t surprise the next person coming on with a half-stocked, half-prepped kitchen.  One way to “not surprise” someone is to, at least, put notes in the log (or the whiteboard) about what needs to be done, & text the person coming in next so that they know.

We have key nights where food is important.  Having the full menu up and available on those days is essential.

In addition to that, and for everyone’s benefit, we are trying to build a consistent food business.  Running out of items that impact multiple menu items (like cheese, pizza crusts, chicken, bacon, etc.) is devastating; it damages customer loyalty, and it hurts our bottom line. 

If we’re out of, or short of something, we don’t want to find out after we’re already open the next day.  We all have busy schedules and many days don’t allow for someone to drop what they’re doing and go “pick up” and prepare whatever we run out of.  First-shift bar staff are frequently assigned special tasks that need to be completed during the day -- those individuals cannot be taken off of their job duties because an emergency need to cook and prep items that should have, and could have, been taken care of by the previous shift. 

If we’re going to run out of something, either prep it, or make arrangements to prep it (or have it prepped) -- don’t leave it to someone else.  If a task is going to be bumped to the FOH opener, clear that with your manager before assuming doing so is ok.   The manager is the only person allowed to make a decision on what may or may not be temporarily left off the menu.

Ordering:  How much inventory is too much?  Strike a balance between carrying inventory and making sure arrangements are made to get ingredients BEFORE we run out -- as a matter of necessity (mostly storage space), we cannot carry extra inventory, and our goal is to only maintain about two weeks worth of inventory at any given time.  

The key to making this all work is to avoid surprises, and to communicate.  Make sure someone knows if tasks (or inventory) are incomplete before you leave your shift -- the FOH opener is not responsible for looking at the whiteboard in the kitchen when they come in -- at that point it’s already too late for them to make a quick stop on their way in to pick up the simple things we may need.  If we will be needing something the next morning, coordinate with your manager so that the proper people are contacted.  If you’re an opener, or mid-shifter, informing only the FOH Closer isn’t adequate, since they may not be opening the next day -- let your manager know ASAP.
