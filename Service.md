## Service Expectations

Here’s the steps we’d like to see for all customers:

1. Greet the guests:  Let them know that you’ve acknowledged them and that they are important to us.

1. Sell it: Offer a beverage and let the guest know of food specials and/or things that aren't printed on the menu.  Know the beers and our other offerings so that you can sell them knowledgeably.

1. Bring them their beverage, then take their food order.

1. Deliver their order, and when appropriate, describe the food or drink to enhance "the visual" aspects of service and the customer's sense of being important to you and to us.

1. Check back, Sell another beverage -- if that glass is 3/4 empty, it’s time to offer another beer.  If the glass is already empty, and they hesitate before they say "no," offer a half pint as an alternative to a full pint. (Don’t over-serve, of course)

1. Clear all food items and empty glassware as soon as they’re empty or ignored (typically, a napkin on a plate means, "I’m done").  Ask if they enjoyed their food/drink, and offer a dessert-drink or snack.  When they’re finished, bring their ticket and thank them.

Remember:  When you are working, you are a 'character', not necessarily your true self.  We try to hire people that we feel can play the role, and present the experience that we, as Slaughter County, want to present to all our customers regardless of who their server is. Your "character" needs to sell to make tips. Typically, the higher the ticket price, the bigger the tip.  Follow these simple rules and you’ll be in great shape.

Avoid "I-sore":  This is about the "character" you should be playing when you’re in front of customers.  "I-sore" happens when you refer to yourself and, especially, your opinions (and especially negative ones) in front of the customer.  This is about them -- and listen to the customer (you’re not a good communicator if you can carry on a monologue -- great communicators, when in conversation, have great listening skills).  Never say, "I don’t like XYZ because…."  Make suggestions.  Some personality works to help sell, but don’t think of that in terms of your personal opinions, think of it in terms of your character’s mission and job, and in terms of your character’s goal, (and your job as an ambassador to our brands) which is to provide a great customer experience, and increase the ticket price so that your character will help the success of Slaughter County and, at the end of the day, increase your tips.  Yay!  :-)
