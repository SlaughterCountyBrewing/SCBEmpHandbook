## Drug & Alcohol Policy

This is the basics -- if you have any questions, ask.

- no drug use, selling, buying, etc. on the job or on site at slaughter county brewing (SCB).  This includes marijuana.
- no alcohol consumption on site, during work hours, except in the line of one’s job duties and as allowed by state law - as a manufacturer, we’re allowed QA testing.
- Extracurricular alcohol/drug use that affects one’s performance at work will lead to disciplinary actions -- don’t come to work drunk or high!  Give yourself time to sober up.
- Drug Testing
    - reasoning -- fitness for job & safety concerns
	- pre-employment screening
	    - consent form required -- will be kept in employee file
	    - all applicants will undergo a test
	    - failure of the test will be a disqualification for employment
	    - screenings will not look for marijuana as it’s legal in WA state for personal use
	    - cost of this test will be slaughter county brewery’s expense
	    - Pre-employment screening may be waived at SCB’s discretion
	- employee random testing
	    - consent form required -- to be kept in employee file
	    - testing is mandatory, & random
	    - any current employees may be tested without notice
	    - The cost of a negative test will be slaughter county brewery’s expense
	    - if employee fails a screening, that employee is responsible for the cost of that test and all of their future drug tests
	    - screenings will only look for and act upon the presence of marijuana if on-the-job use has been reported
	- Failure of a drug test
	    - Failure of a drug test may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination

Our intent here is to promote a healthy, clean, and safe environment for our customers and employees.  Disciplinary action may require treatment, health intervention, and/or ongoing testing outside of Slaughter County’s purview as a term of continued employment.
